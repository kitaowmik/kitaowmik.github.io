     <h1>the house you left me.</h1>
     <p class="desc">My game the house you left me is the story of a woman who is exploring a house. The house has been left to her by her best friend, who has been found dead in the house under mysterious circumstances. This is a short, interactive game that provides two different endings depending on choices made by the player. It explores themes of isolation, acceptance, and grief. This was my BFA project for SJSU. It was made using the Narrat program, utilizing HTML, CSS, Adobe Photoshop, and Adobe After Effects.<br><br> <a href="https://dawndeer.itch.io/the-house-you-left-me" class="ignore-css">The game can be played here.</a></p>
