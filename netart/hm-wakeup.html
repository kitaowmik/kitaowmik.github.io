<p>When I wake up it's because he's kicking my foot.</p>
<p>He kicks my leg again, and his foot moves like its being pulled by a string.</p>
<p>I move back. "I'm awake."</p>
<p>"Your stop." His mouth is still moving very strangely.</p>
<p>The train stops.</p>
<p>I get up.</p>
<p>"Thank you," I tell him.</p>
<p>As I leave the compartment, I see the woman in the one across. She is pressed against the glass, staring at me.</p>
<p>She smiles.</p>
