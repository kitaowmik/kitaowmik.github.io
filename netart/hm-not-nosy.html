<p>Neither of you talk.</p>
<p>You look out the window.</p>
<p>He looks at you.</p>
<p>He does not stop looking at you.</p>
<p>The train passes over something, a bump, or a very big rock, and you balance yourself.</p>
<p>The man does not balance himself. He tips forward and his hat falls off.</p>
<p>There is a rat under his hat.</p>
<br>
<p>The rat looks at you.</p>
<p>You look at the rat.</p>
<br>
<p>The rat smiles, wider and wider, until it is more smile than rat.</p>
<p>The smile asks you a question.</p>
