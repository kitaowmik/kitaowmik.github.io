<title>It's cold.</title>

<p>"It's pretty cold, isn't it?"</p>
<p>Her smile freezes, and for a second, I think something is wrong.</P>
<p>But then she says, "yes, it has been getting colder at night now."</p>
<p>"I'm scared I'll fall asleep and miss my stop," I admit.</p>
<p>"What's your stop?"</p>
<p>"The next one after this."</p>
<p>"I'll wake you up," she offers."</p>
<p>I think this is nice, and I thank her.</p>
<p>She starts to smile again, and I stop thinking she is nice.</p>
