<p>I wake up. I can't believe I fell asleep. I was just trying not to look at her teeth.</p>
<p>The train is still moving. Of course it is.</p>
<p>The lady is still there. She pulls a bit of fur out of her mouth.</p>
<p>She sees me staring. "The coat is shedding," she explains. "Did you sleep well?"</p>
<p>"I did."</p>
<p>"That's nice. You slept for a long time."</p>
<p>"Did I miss my stop?" That would be bad. Mostly because I don't want to be around her teeth any longer.</p>
<p>"You said it's the one after the next?"</p>
<p>"Yes."</p>
<p>"Then no." </p>
<p>"Where are we now? Is my stop next?"</p>
<p>"The train hasn't stopped at all."</p>
<p>"That's strange. I feel like I slept hours." I don't know why I keep talking. She keeps talking back, so I keep seeing bits of her stupid teeth."<p>
<p>"You did." She checks her watch. "You slept two hours."</p>
<p>"Then I missed my stop."</p>
<p>I just told you the train hasn't stopped."</p>
<p>"But if it's been two hours-"</p>
<p>"I told you." She is smiling again. "The train has not stopped."
