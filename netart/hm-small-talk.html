<p>"It's pretty cold, isn't it?"</p>
<p>His mouth wobbles, like it's a worm. I've never seen a mouth move like that.</P>
<p>But then he says, "yes."</p>
<p>He must not be the sort to talk. "Is your stop coming soon?"</p>
<p>He does something strange with his shoulders, and then his mouth wobbles again. "No."</p>
<p>"Mine is the next one after this. Will you wake me if I take a nap?"</p>
<p>His eye twitches. This would not be weird if he was not already a very weird man. Adter a long moment of mouth wobbling, he says, "yes."</p>
