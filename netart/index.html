<h1>Just a train ride.</h1>
<p>The train stops. I see all the carriages ahead get full, so I go to the emptiest one. It's the kitchen carriage, and there are only three compartments.</p>
<p>The train starts moving, and I stumble. I have to sit somewhere. </p>
<a href="the-woman-path.html"><b>One compartment on the left has a woman in a fur coat. I sit there.</b></a>
<p><a href="the-hatman-path.html"><b>One compartment on the right has a man in a top hat. I sit there.</b></a></p>
<p><a href="index.html"><b>I have a strange feeling, that I am stuck in a dream. Can I go back home?</b></a></p>
