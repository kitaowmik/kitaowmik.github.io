     <p class="desc">Click on the image to experience this webpage! This was a project created with HTML, CSS, and the Javascript library ThreeJS. I have a deep fascination with vast bodies of water; to me, they represent isolation. College can be a lonely experience, and this project was done to reflect that. I believe this is a concept many people can connect with, and I think this is something important to consider in web design. Websites don't always have to merely promote something, they can impart dynamic experiences and visual concepts that people can relate to.</p>
