     <h1>time relapse.</h1>
     <p class="desc">This was a project where the prompt was "Everyday Horror". My spin on it was to have a narrator who was exhausted with their daily life. As their life grows more monotone, the narrator's internal monologue slips into fantastical and eerie daydreams of escaping the prison of their current life. This was created using Adobe After Effects and Premiere Pro, as well as Blender.</p>
