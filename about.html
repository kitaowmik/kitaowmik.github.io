		<br>
	  <p class="text-center">My name is Ankita and I am a DMA student at SJSU. This is my current portfolio.</p>
	  <p class="text-left">My goal with my art is to create works that people can feel they are a part of. As someone who is passionate about both art and storytelling, I hope to make games that are visual narratives for people to enjoy and immerse themselves in. While I can appreciate all forms of art, I want to be involved in art where I feel that others can in some way leave their mark as well. Using technology to enhance and improve upon my art is something that I love exploring and learning about. Using technology allows me to make art that is responsive and this caters well towards my creative goals. 
 <p class="text-left">I hope to utilize digital art and coding languages to go about achieving my goals. I’m interested in incorporating coding into my art and finding unconventional ways to create art using technology. By using code and other forms of computer image-making I hope to create stories that can be a part of peoples’ lives for a long time, and I hope that the art I create can be something people can always come back to. Not only that, but by incorporating coding and other digital aspects into my art, I hope that people can carry what I create around on their phones or have easy access to it on their computers. It is important for me to create art that others can reach and connect with.</p> 
 <p class="text-left">As I originally started off in traditional art mediums like oil paints, I am also interested in repurposing traditional painting with digital elements. I think there are some amazing results that can be achieved when you merge together traditional mediums with those of new media. Using code and other software to manipulate my traditional artwork sends an important message of what we can achieve by combining art and technology. I think it’s important to question our pre-existing perceptions on what art can be and to open ourselves to how we can change art that already exists and to change our ideas on what mediums can be considered art. The clear goal I can see for myself is to create stories with my art and to hope that any future audience I have might consider those stories to be art. However, in a broader sense, I want to take the art I already make and see how I can change with new media art mediums. Essentially, I want to be able to explore several forms of computational art-making and use what I learn to achieve my artistic goals.</p>
